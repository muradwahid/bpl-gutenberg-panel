# DynamicTag Component

The `DynamicTag` component is a React component designed to dynamically render an HTML tag based on the `tagName` prop provided.

## Props

- `tagName`: The HTML tag name to be dynamically rendered.
- `restProps`: Additional props to be passed to the dynamically rendered tag.

## Usage

```jsx
import { DynamicTag } from 'path/to/DynamicTag';

<DynamicTag tagName="div">
  Content goes here
</DynamicTag>
```

## Note

The `DynamicTag` component is particularly useful when the type of HTML tag to be rendered needs to be determined dynamically at runtime. It provides a convenient way to create reusable components that can adapt to different tag types based on the context.

I hope this README provides a clear understanding of the `DynamicTag` component!
